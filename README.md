# AirLinePassengerPredictor
Dataset is collected from Kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/chirag19/air-passengers
This dataset provides monthly totals of a US airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. This dataset is taken from an inbuilt dataset of R called AirPassengers.

In this project I have tried to predict number of passengers travelled in a particular month using RNN.
